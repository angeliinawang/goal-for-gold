# goal-for-gold

GoalforGold is an extensive progress and goal tracker app prototype dedicated towards sports that are commonly overlooked in current-day fitness apps, including dance, figure skating, and gymnastics. The purpose of our app is to create a platform that allows athletes of sports of lower athletic recognition to experience the same functionalities that other disciplines are provided in large fitness apps today. This includes features like measuring flexibility, tracking attempted skills (e.g. triple axel, quadruple pirouette) and scaling them by the user's level of proficiency, and keeping track of meets and competitions.

FEATURES

Upon starting off in the app, you can select from 15 lower-recognition sports and add a total of five sports to their homepage. The application prototype showcases three specific features: a scalable goal tracker, a calendar, and a homepage that cumulates all of your goals and upcoming events.
1) The goal tracker allows you to choose a particular goal you have within a sports discipline and set a date you wish to reach the goal. There is a percentage scale to set your proficiency on the goal, which can be measured at your discretion.
2) The calendar will display time-set goals you add through the goal tracker. Upcoming events can also be added to the calendar and are displayed alongside the goals.
3) The homepage is the default page of the app and displays a daily quote from a famous athlete and a dashboard containing all of your selected sports and current ongoing goals.
4) A profile page is also available, allowing you to set your profile name and picture and handle privacy options.

The web app is created using HTML/CSS and JavaScript on Glitch online IDE. This app prototype was created for the Major League Hacking Winter Hacklympics in December 2020 and received the "First Gold Medal" award out of 70+ projects. I collaborated with two other high school students (Lauryn Chau and Freda Zhao) in building, scaling, and marketing the application. The visual prototype was created with Figma design frameworks. Design assets of the application were created in Canva.

ADDITIONAL

Due to the scope of the hackathon, the entire project was created within a 24-hour framework. The web app is missing certain JavaScript functionalities that are described in our Devpost video due to a limited experience in the coding language and provided time.
